# About this guide

## **About the authors**

This guide is brought to you by [**Greaterthan**](http://greaterthan.works), an organization with the mission to make participatory governance in organizations the new normal by spreading culture, knowledge and practices. We want to make collaborative funding easy and accessible to anyone.

**The authors** of this playbook, **Francesca Pick and Kate Beecroft,** have over a decade of experience in participatory governance, self-organization and community building. The knowledge shared here stems from their first-hand experiences as leaders and practitioners in global networks such as [Enspiral](https://enspiral.com/) and [Ouishare](https://www.ouishare.net/), and the growing practice of collaborative budgeting they have helped to develop in these networks.
