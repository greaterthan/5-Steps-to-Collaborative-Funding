# Introduction

**For any group or organization to be effective, it needs to be able to make decisions about how to allocate its resources.** Especially for organizations aiming to be self-managing, participatory, or 'teal', collaborative decision-making models for allocating funds are not very developed yet. Tools such as Cobudget can make collaborative budgeting and funding process easier, but there is much more to successful budget allocation than just one tool!
